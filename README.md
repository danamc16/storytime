#StoryTime

##Purpose

The most democratic form of technology is not a computer but a cell phone. Moreover, parents may not have the time to take their children to the library or prepare stories for their children.

StoryTime sends users a nightly text with a short bedtime story and accompanying activities based on their child's age. Working with the New Haven YMCA and New Haven Reads, StoryTime is bringing bedtime stories and technology together.

##Functionality

Because StoryTime is focused on the text message platform, the site features a simple signup along with additional information about the project.

Users put in their cell phone numbers and then list their child's birthday and what time the text should arrive. The website's backend then does the rest of the work. The site currently sends text messages and plans to integrate the timed text message function in the next version.

##Design Philosophy

Parents are already rushed as it is, so we made the interface and signup as smooth as possible. The interface was designed that at minimum, all we need is a cell phone number; if the parent does not make it to birthday and time, they will still receive a message.

The front page design is also intended to be clean and easy to read and use.
